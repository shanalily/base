/*
Package worker provides a Pool of goroutines where you can submit Jobs
to be run by an exisiting goroutine instead of spinning off a new goroutine. This pool provides
goroutine reuse in a non-blocking way. The pool will have an always available number of
goroutines equal to the number of CPUs on the machine. Any Submit() calls that cause a queue
block will cause a new goroutine to be created. These extra goroutines will continue to process
jobs until they are idle for a certain amount of time. At that point they will be collected.
This prevents work from being blocked by a queue that is full.

This pool can create other synchronization primitives such as a Limited pool that allows reuse while
limiting the number of concurrent goroutines. You can also create a Group object, an alternative to WaitGroup,
that will allow safe execution of a number of goroutines and then wait for them to finish.

The Pool will also provide metrics on the number of goroutines that have been created and are running.

The Pool is NOT for background processing that has no return values. It is for processing that needs to
be done in the foreground but you don't want to spin off a new goroutine for each job. For background
processing, you should use the base/concurrency/background package.

Normal way of getting a Pool (using the default Pool):

	pool := context.Pool(ctx)

Creating a Pool that has its own metrics:

	pool := context.Pool(ctx).Sub(ctx, "poolNameUniqueToPkg")

Creating a completely separate Pool (rarely needed):

	pool, err := worker.New(ctx, "myPool")
	// Wait for the pool to finish and stop all goroutines. Because we didn't set a deadline
	// this will wait up to 30 seconds. See Close() for details.
	defer p.Close(ctx)

Example of creating and using a Pool:

	ctx := context.Background() // Use base/context package to create a context.

	// Submit a job to the pool.
	// This will be run by an existing goroutine in the pool.
	// If there are no goroutines available, a new one will be created.
	// If the context is canceled before the job is run, the job will not be run.
	// If the context is canceled after the job is run, it is the responsibility of the job to check the context
	// and return if it is canceled.
	pool.Submit(
		ctx,
		func() { fmt.Println("Hello, world!") },
	})

Generally you don't wait for the pool to finish. You can just let it run and submit jobs to it. You can call close,
but it is not necessary. If you need to wait for a specific group of goroutines to finish, you can use the
.Group() method.

Example of using the pool for a WaitGroup effect:

	g := pool.Group()

	// Spin off a goroutine that will run a job.
	g.Go(
		ctx,
		func(ctx context.Context) error {
			fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
			return nil
		},
	)

	// Wait for all goroutines to finish. If ctx is canceled, it will return immediately with an error
	// (which we aren't capturing as we aren't cancelling).
	if err := g.Wait(ctx); err != nil {
		// Do something
	}

If you need to limit the number of concurrent goroutines that can run for something, you can create a Limited
pool from the Pool.

Example of creating and using a Limited pool:

	// Create a Limited pool from the Pool.
	// This will limit the number of concurrent goroutines to 10.
	l, err := p.Limited(ctx, "poolName", 10)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	l.Submit(
		ctx,
		func() { fmt.Println("Hello, world!") },
	)

	l.Wait() // Again, generally we don't wait for the pool to finish.

You can also use the Limited pool with a WaitGroup effect:

	g := l.Group()

	g.Go(
		ctx,
		func() error {
			fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
			return nil
		},
	)

	if err := g.Wait(ctx); err != nil {
		// Do something
	}

We also provide a PriorityQueue for running jobs from pools. It is recommended to use a Limited pool.

	for i, work := range []func() {
		job := QJob{Priority: i, Work: work}
		limitedPool.Submit(ctx, job)
	}

There is package, base/values/generics/promises, that offers a Promise object for submitting a job and getting the
result back. This is useful for when you want to run a job, do some other work, and then get the result back.

	p := NewPromise[string]()

	_ := g.Submit(
		ctx,
		func(ctx) error {
			p.Set(ctx, "Hello, world!", nil)
			return nil
		},
	)

	// Do other work...

	fmt.Println(p.Get().V)
